# Plugging out the device

By looking at the [capture file](captures/plug_out.pcapng) of when the device
gets plugged out, there don't seem to be any special behavior from the Setting
Utility during this particular moment.

The discussion between the Setting Utility and the device look the same as when
they are both idle.
